# Lab Projects Ideas

- Each team should choose one idea from the listed ideas.


- A team is formed by 2, 3, or 4 members.
- After choosing your idea, send to me an email with the **team members**, **team name**, and **the idea** and wait for a **confirmation** from me.
- Projects ideas should be balanced over all the teams. I might force a team to an idea if there aren't enough teams in it.
- Each project contains a **bonus** task.
- **Copying** code from each others is **forbidden**.
